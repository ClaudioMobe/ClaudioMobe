- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClaudioMobe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in so so so so many things. I am an aerospace engineering student (actually coursing the fifth period out of ten), but I also love to seek for new     knowledge it doesnÂ´t matter of what kind.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development, at the moment I know HTML, CSS and I consider myself intermediate in JavaScript. Right now I am learning React.js in my path   for becoming a front-end developer.
