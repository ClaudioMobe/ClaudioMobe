Hello, I am Claudio Morales, I am a Front End developer and an aerospace engineering student and I love to learn everything I can about the world that we live in :)  

My first contact with programming was in High School, but I experienced it in an old fashioned way that didn't get my attention. Then, in college, I discovered the wonders of programming and the things that someone can achieve through it and I started to learn it deeper on my own, finding special attraction to web development. I consider myself a junior Front End Developer with strong knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.
