Hello, I am Claudio Morales, I am an aerospace engineering student and I love to learn everything I can about the world that we live in :)  

My first contact with programming was in High School, but I experienced it in an old an iterative way that didn't get my attention. Then, in college, I discovered the wonders of this discipline and I started to learn it on my own. I consider myself a junior Front End Developer with knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Lately, I learned React JS and that's what I am using to develope my personal projects.
